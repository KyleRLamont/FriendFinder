## Problem: 
Want to date but hate actually going out? Here's Friend-Finder. Think if Facebook, Tinder, and OKCupid had a baby. It's the app no one asked for.

## Organization: 
The app is organized as-
1. HTML in separate database for public so that it will be what is seen by users.
2. Express routing handled through another database to both deliver the webpages and then to handle the information submitted by the user with the information contained on the server.
3. The friends array is also stored separately. All of the separation means that addressing bugs/ updating is seamless with the other components of the app and easier.

## Using the App: 
To use the app, simply click the link at the top and then click the Start Survey button. This will take you to the survey page. You must enter your name, provide a link to a photo from the web, and answer all 10 questions. Once answered, you will be presented with a pop-up window with the best match from the array of participants. (Note: Participants are fictional and images were provided through the course). Congratulations!
